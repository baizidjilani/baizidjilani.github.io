In the final year of my undergrad studies, I had the privilege of working part-time as a research assistant on a university research project titled "SUFEDB: A facial expression database for emotion recognition" under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Sadia Sultana.
<ul>
  <li>
    Played a vital role in creating a facial expression dataset, handling participantsâ€™ coordination, informed 
   consent, and image annotation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensured data uniformity through rigorous preprocessing, including image resizing, removing noise if necessary, 
    and format standardization.
  </li>
  <li>
    Contributed to goal setting, model selection, model evaluation, and fine-tuning of the prepared dataset.
  </li>
</ul>
