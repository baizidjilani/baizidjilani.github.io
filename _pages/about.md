# About Me
---------------------
I am a first year PhD student at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. My research focuses on computer vision and its applications in the medical field. I am particularly interested in deriving meaningful information from medical, biomedical and microscopy images to address the critical clinical problems. I received my bachelor's degree from Shahjalal University of Science & Technology (SUST) in 2023, majoring in Computer Science & Engineering.

  In the final year of my undergrad studies, I had the privilege of working part-time as a research assistant on a university research project titled "<strong>SUFEDB: A facial expression database for emotion recognition</strong>". I collected consent from participants and annotated expression images via OpenCV. I had also done preprocessing of images to ensure data uniformity of the dataset. In addition, I had evaluated and analyzed the performance of current state-of-the-art CNN models on the dataset.

In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in expressing thoughts and feelings on social media rather than in face-to-face conversation. Social networks, especially Reddit, have emerged as powerful platforms for sharing depression, which can be utilized to analyze the trends of depression. For this, we collected a bulk amount of depression-related data (1M posts) crawling from Reddit and utilized NLTK for text processing and custom functions for text cleaning. We preprocessed the data in a time-based approach: Incremental Window and Sliding Window. We used pre-trained word embeddings like Skip-gram and GloVe for analyzing trends related to depression, leveraging the semantic relationships encoded in word vectors.
