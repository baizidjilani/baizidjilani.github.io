# About Me
---------------------
Hello, I'm Golam Jilani, a computer science graduate student. I received my bachelor's degree from Shahjalal University of Science & Technology (SUST) in 2023, majoring in Computer Science & Engineering. I am broadly interested in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Data Mining.

    <div style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Reasearch Assistant</strong></div>
    <div>Nov 2022 - Feb 2023</div>

Supervisor: <a href="https://www.sust.edu/d/cse/faculty-profile-detail/44" target="_blank"> Dr. Sadia Sultana</a> <br>
<div>
  In the final year of my undergrad studies, I had the privilege of working part-time as a research assistant on a university research project titled "<strong>SUFEDB: A facial expression database for emotion recognition</strong>". I collected consent from participants and annotated expression images via OpenCV. I had also done preprocessing of images to ensure data uniformity of the dataset. In addition, I had evaluated and analyzed the performance of current state-of-the-art CNN models on the dataset.
