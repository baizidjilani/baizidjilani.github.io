# About Me
---------------------
Hello, I'm Golam Jilani, a computer science graduate student. I received my bachelor's degree from Shahjalal University of Science & Technology (SUST) in 2023, majoring in Computer Science & Engineering. My research interests are in the areas of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Data Mining. I am interested in deriving meaningful information from texts/images/videos to solve real-world problems.

<div>
  In the final year of my undergrad studies, I had the privilege of working part-time as a research assistant on a university research project titled "<strong>SUFEDB: A facial expression database for emotion recognition</strong>". I collected consent from participants and annotated expression images via OpenCV. I had also done preprocessing of images to ensure data uniformity of the dataset. In addition, I had evaluated and analyzed the performance of current state-of-the-art CNN models on the dataset.

<!-- <span style="opacity: 0.8;"> **DepressionTrend: Leveraging Dynamic Word Embeddings to Analyze the Trends of Depression** </span>  -->
In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in expressing thoughts and feelings on social media rather than in face-to-face conversation. Social networks, especially Reddit, have emerged as powerful platforms for sharing depression, which can be utilized to analyze the trends of depression.
<ul style="opacity: 0.8;">
  <li>Collected a bulk amount of depression-related data (1M posts) crawling from Reddit. </li>
  <li>Utilized NLTK for text processing and custom functions for text cleaning. </li>
  <li>Preprocessed the data in a time-based approach:- Incremental Window and Sliding Window. </li>
  <li>Used pre-trained word embeddings like Skip-gram and GloVe for analyzing trends related to depression 
       involves leveraging the semantic relationships encoded in word vectors. </li>
  <li> Monitored the changes in word embeddings using temporal data. </li>
</ul>
