In the final year of my undergrad studies, I had the privilege of working part-time as a research assistant on a university research project titled "SUFEDB: A facial expression database for emotion recognition" under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Sadia Sultana.

* Played a vital role in creating a facial expression dataset, handling participantsâ€™ coordination, informed consent, and image annotation.
* Ensured data uniformity through rigorous preprocessing, including image resizing, removing noise if necessary, and format standardization.
* contributed to goal setting, model selection, model evaluation, and fine-tuning of the prepared dataset.
